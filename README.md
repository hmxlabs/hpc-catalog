# HPC Catalog
![HPC Catalog Image](hpc-catalog.jpg)

A community driven catalog of tools and products that are useful in the world of high performance computing (HPC)

This content has been contributed to by numerous people and started life as a post on [HMx Labs Flux](https://cloudhpc.news/hpc-product-directory/) and [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hamza_high-performance-computing-is-a-funny-fragmented-activity-7240252941645815808-caCq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). The later after SC24 on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/hpcwrangler.com/post/3lbosls3kes2g) too.

There continues to be engagement and a community willingness to maintain this so I will continue to do so. However it should be noted this rather fantastic resource also exists [Awesome HPC](https://github.com/dstdev/awesome-hpc)
